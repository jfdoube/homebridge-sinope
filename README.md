# homebridge-sinope

Homebridge sinope is an homebridge plugin for Sinope baseboard thermostats.

For more information about Sinope thermostats, visit http://www.sinopetech.com

Sinope thermostats run along with a web application called neviweb which is basically a responsive web application that does ajax calls to a web api.

homebridge-sinope uses these web api so that you can interact with siri as an alternative to neviweb.

Notes: This is still a beta version.
Todos: Add lint, tests, refactor
